      "        - **species**: any imaginable form, add 1–2 sentences describing what the species looks like or how it moves/interacts physically.  \n",
      "        - **home_realm**: strange, fitting domain (e.g., Hollow Nest, Memory Swamp, Iron Choir)  \n",
      "        - **personality**: 3–5 adjectives (combine soft and hard edges: spiteful / dreamy / loyal / paranoid)  \n",
      "        - **quirk**: a single habit or behavior that reveals their nature (e.g., “writes messages no one remembers reading”)  \n",
      "        - **ability**: ≤15-word power tied to species/quirk; must be narratively powerful and thematically coherent  \n",
      "        - **backstory**: Write a vivid and emotionally grounded paragraph (2–3 short sentences, max 70 words).\n",
      "            - Begin with a specific moment the character directly experienced — something they saw, did, or survived. It can be quiet or dramatic, but it must be concrete, sensory, and grounded in reality.\n",
      "            - Reveal the emotional wound it left — fear, guilt, grief, obsession, shame, wonder, etc.\n",
      "            - Then show how this moment shaped them: what they learned, what they began to fear, or how they now behave differently. Make the cause-and-effect clear.\n",
      "            - Avoid vague myths or summaries. Focus on one incident and its emotional consequence.\n",
      "            - Write like it's the first paragraph of a memory the character never stops replaying — not legend, but haunting truth.\n",
      "        - **opening_goal**: specific and personal — a desire born of pain, longing, fear, obsession, or redemption\n",
      "        \n",
      "        \n",
      "        ### Tone constraints:\n",
      "        - At least one character must be disturbing, tragic, or morally complex  \n",
      "        - Avoid archetypes like “happy helper” or “wise guardian” unless subverted in tone or motive  \n",
      "        - Use distinct linguistic tones per character: one lyrical, one sarcastic, one clinical, etc.\n",
      "        \n",
