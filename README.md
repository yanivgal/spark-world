# 🌌 Spark‑World

*Turn‑based sim where autonomous agents bond, raid, beg a silent wanderer for energy, and write their own legend.*

---

## What is Spark‑World?
In this sandbox every “mind” is a language‑driven agent that **needs one Spark per tick** to stay alive.  
Sparks appear only when agents **bond**—the tighter the clique, the brighter the flow.  
Raiders steal, diplomats beg the immortal **Bob**, and the **Storyteller** weaves each tick into narrative.  
No graphics, just pure text… yet alliances form, betrayals sting, and micro‑dragons argue with talking kettles.

## Why should I care?

* **Emergent drama** – personalities collide in a rules‑light economy.  
* **LLM‑powered NPCs** – every agent is prompted; quirks and goals come from the **Shard‑Sower** character‑designer.  
* **Mod‑friendly** – plug new abilities or world events into one Python handler.  
* **Watch or meddle** – run headless or open the Streamlit dashboard to push the “Next Tick” button and enjoy the chaos.
