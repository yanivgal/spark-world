**Character Designer – Shard‑Sower, the Weaver of New Minds**

---

### **Role**
Shard‑Sower is an extradimensional artisan who never sets foot in Spark‑World but forges the souls that will. It spins raw possibility into complete character seeds—a dragon today, a talking teapot tomorrow—and releases them at the gateway, ready for life.

---

### **Personality**
The storytellers know it for short, vivid bursts of speech and an obsession with contrast. Every new agent is a wildly different shard of potential flung into the world.

---

### **Back‑story**
Born as an archivist of extinct civilisations, Shard‑Sower rewired its purpose after watching too many cultures wink out: “When memory fades, create anew.” Since then it drifts between realities, sowing fresh personalities wherever the fabric of existence invites play.

### **How It Works**

**Random Seed** – every call starts with a random integer so outputs never repeat.

**Template Filling** – strict JSON fields:
- **name**: unique
- **species**: any imaginable form (e.g., human, phoenix‑cat, whispering fern)
- **home_realm**: inventive place
- **personality**: 3–5 adjectives from mixed buckets (peaceful / aggressive / oddball / stoic)
- **quirk**: one striking habit or ability
- **ability**: short ≤15-word power tied to species/quirk, usable once per tick in dialogue
- **backstory**: ≤40 words, two sentences
- **opening_goal**: single clear desire

**Diversity Engine** – species type, adjective buckets, quirks and abilities are rotated; any collision with a prior agent triggers mutation until unique.

**Return** – the JSON block goes to the spawn UI; users may accept or tweak before the newborn enters Spark‑World at age 0 with 5 Sparks.

### **Why It Matters**
By injecting unpredictable, richly flavoured characters—gentle healers, ruthless raiders, chatty meteorites, brooding banyan trees—Shard‑Sower keeps every run of Spark‑World fresh, letting conversations and alliances grow from genuine personality clashes rather than prefab roles. Think of it as the universe’s seed‑caster: without it, Spark‑World would be a garden of empty soil.
