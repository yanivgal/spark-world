## üß© Mission Meetings ‚Äì Collaborative Planning Inside Each Tick

### What is a Mission Meeting?

Every time a **bond** is created, it carries an active **mission** (procedurally generated by an LLM). Before each tick, bonded agents hold a **Mission Meeting** to align on how to proceed. This is not a one-time event ‚Äî it's a **repeating collaboration flow** that happens **every single iteration** for every mission in progress.

**Note:** Currently, missions are one-time events. When a mission is completed, the bond continues without a mission but can still generate Sparks through bonding. Future versions may include new mission generation or different mission types.

### When It Happens

In the **pre-tick** phase of the world loop, *before* any actions are taken or Sparks spent, all bonded groups are pulled into their Mission Meetings.

### Mission Meeting Flow (per iteration)

1. **Start Meeting**

   - The **World Engine** identifies each active mission and its bonded agents.
   - It designates (or remembers) a **mission leader** for the bond.

2. **Leader Introduction (First Tick Only)**

   - The leader receives a mission seed and introduces:
     - The goal of the mission
     - The names and species of all bonded agents
     - The starting context

3. **Leader‚Äôs Opening Message (Each Tick)**

   - The leader reflects on the **previous iteration‚Äôs actions**.
   - Sends a new message to all bond members, prompting input:
     - ‚ÄúWhat should we do next?‚Äù
     - ‚ÄúWhat did we learn from last time?‚Äù

4. **Agent Responses**

   - Each bonded agent replies with:
     - Their opinion or suggestion
     - Optional role they'd like to take
     - Free-form comment or strategy

5. **Leader‚Äôs Final Word**

   - The leader receives all replies.
   - Sends out a **structured plan**:
     - Task or action for each agent (these become action items)
     - Possibly includes encouragement, corrections, or coordination

6. **Wrap-Up**

   - The action items for each agent are **recorded** in the mission state.
   - They are also included in each agent‚Äôs **Observation Packet** (so the agent sees what they were asked to do this tick).

---

### What‚Äôs in the Mission Observation Packet?

Each bonded agent‚Äôs observation packet now includes:

- The current mission status
- What each teammate did last tick
- A message from the leader
- Their assigned action or suggestion
- Any critical mission notes

---

### Why It Matters

This recurring meeting flow brings life to cooperation:

- Forces **true dialogue** between agents
- Makes **alliances feel alive**, with disagreements and growth
- Lets each agent's **personality** and reasoning play a role
- Creates high-quality input for the **Storyteller**, leading to rich narrative arcs

### Mission Disagreements

What happens when bonded agents can't agree on mission strategy? This is the beauty of the simulation - we get to observe how different personalities navigate conflict and cooperation. The agents must work through their disagreements through dialogue, and their success or failure becomes part of the emergent story. There's no forced consensus - the outcome depends entirely on the agents' personalities and communication skills.
