## The Pitch

**"Imagine a world where AI agents don't just follow instructionsâ€”they create their own stories. That's Spark-World. It's a simulation where autonomous AI agents with unique personalities form alliances, betray each other, and write their own legends through their interactions. Every run is completely different because the agents think for themselves. A shy flower might become a ruthless leader, or a proud knight might learn humility. It's not just a gameâ€”it's a glimpse into how AI can create emergent storytelling that humans never could have written. We built it using AI-assisted development, learning how to break complex problems into pieces that AI can handle. The result? A system where AI agents collaborate, create, and surprise us. It's the future of human-AI collaboration, and it's working right now."**
