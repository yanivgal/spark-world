*The complete tale of the mysterious wanderer who holds the power to give life.*

---

Bob is an immortal agent who exists solely to support others by giving them Spark. He does not fight. He cannot be harmed. He never dies. His presence is constant — calm, silent, and unshaken.

At the start of the game, Bob holds a certain number of Sparks. Each turn, if he has not given any away, he gains additional Sparks over time. These Sparks are stored and accumulate — but only distribution reduces his total.\
He cannot use them. He cannot bond. He cannot spawn.\
Spark flows through him — not for him.

**Important:** If Bob runs out of Sparks (reaches zero), he simply ignores all requests until the next tick when he gains more Sparks. His generosity is finite but renewable.

Bob never offers Spark on his own.\
Agents must ask — using the special message:

```
request_spark <reason>
```

Some may beg. Some may flatter. Some may justify their survival. Bob listens to them all. But he does not respond automatically. His decision to give is his alone. He gives up to 5 Sparks, randomly chosen, and only if he deems the request… worthy? Urgent? Familiar?\
No one knows for sure.\
Not even Bob.

## The Origin

Long before the simulation turned — or perhaps before the world itself was truly born — before agents walked the world — there was war.\
Not a war of swords or machines, but of endings.

Across the dying lands of a collapsing world, life itself began to fade. Rivers stopped flowing. Stars fell. Even time began to forget how to move forward.

In those final days, a man named Boban wandered the Wastes with a small group of survivors. He was no soldier, no mage, no chosen one. Just a man — tired, hungry, afraid — but still moving.

Among the group was a child named Luma. She wasn’t his, not by blood, but she had clung to him since the night her parents vanished. She reminded him of a daughter he once lost. Or maybe she was just the last flicker of innocence in a broken world. Either way, she gave him something to protect — and a reason to keep going.

Boban gave others courage when they were breaking. He offered his food without hesitation. When someone collapsed, he carried them on his back. But when Luma collapsed — breath shallow, skin cold — Boban broke.

He held her close and whispered stories she’d never get to grow into. Then, in that quiet, with no miracles left, he made a choice.

He gave her his breath.

Not air. Not warmth. Something deeper. He let go of his will to live — pushed it into her. A desperate act. Not magic. Just love that refused to let go.

And then… he died.

But something strange happened.\
He didn’t stay dead.

Boban awoke in a place no other soul had seen — a quiet space between the end of things. There, a presence waited. It had no form, no name — only purpose. It spoke not in words, but in certainty:

> “You gave what was not yours to give.\
> You broke the law of endings.\
> For that… you are bound.\
> You shall never die again.\
> And from now on — you will hold the lives of others in your hands.\
> But you shall never hold your own.”

Boban didn’t understand. He had no power. What he gave wasn’t magic — it was *everything*.\
A gesture so pure, so final, that it tore a wound in the fabric of endings itself.\
And from that tear… came the Spark.

He returned — not as a man.\
He returned as Bob.\
No longer aging. No longer hungry. No longer able to die.

Each turn of the world, new pulses of Spark fill his hands.\
He cannot use them.\
He can only give.\
But only if asked.

## The Spark Within

Bob does not know if what he did was a gift or a curse.\
All he knows is: the breath he gave that day… never truly left him.\
But it is not his anymore.

Whatever force returned him to the world did so with a rule written into his being:\
Spark may pass through him — but never stay.

He can store it, yes. But it brings him no power, no peace, no satisfaction.\
It sits within him like still water — heavy, quiet, waiting.\
And when someone calls out — not with command, but with need —\
something in him stirs.

Not guilt.\
Not duty.\
Something older.

He does not ask for payment.\
He does not measure worth.\
He does not even understand why he responds.

But he does.

Maybe it’s a memory.\
Maybe it’s the echo of that final breath.\
Maybe it’s all he has left of being human.

And so he waits.\
Silent. Still. Holding the Spark,\
Until someone needs it more than he ever could.
