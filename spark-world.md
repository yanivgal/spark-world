# ðŸŒŒ  Sparkâ€‘World

What is Sparkâ€‘World?

Imagine a silent void where nothing exists until two minds brush against each other and a single pulse of energy, a Spark that flares into being.

Sparkâ€‘World is a turnâ€‘based, textâ€‘only life-simulation built on that idea:

Agents - LLM-driven personalities as diverse as microâ€‘dragons, cloudâ€‘professors, or sarcastic teapots - struggle to stay alive by earning Sparks through bonding and spending one Spark every tick just to keep their pattern alive.

There are no tiles to move and no hit-points to track. Only conversation. Each turn unfolds entirely in dialogue: agents forge alliances, raid rivals for Sparks, beg mercy from an immortal donor named Bob, and watch a Storyteller weave their choices into an evolving fable.

Over time, simple numeric rules give rise to rivalries, unlikely friendships, and the occasional extinction eventâ€”all written in words rather than pixels.


### The Cast of Sparkâ€‘World

| Entity          | Oneâ€‘line essence                                                                                               | Why they matter                                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sparkâ€¯âš¡**     | A fleeting knot of orderâ€”one per friendship per tick, one burned per life each tick.                           | It is both currency and heartbeat: without Spark, you fade.               |
| **Agents**      | Selfâ€‘sustaining mindsâ€”anything from dragons to talking kettlesâ€”each can send **one actionâ€‘message** per tick.  | They are the players; their choices drive every story turn.               |
| **Bonds**       | Fullyâ€‘connected cliques; a trio yieldsâ€¯3 Sparks, a quartetâ€¯6, etc.                                             | The only natural Spark factory; friendships literally create lifeâ€‘energy. |
| **Bob**         | An immortal wanderer with a finite hoard of Sparks; answers polite pleas with gifts of up toâ€¯5 random Sparks.  | Outside rescue line when your balance runs lowâ€”if Bob feels generous.     |
| **Storyteller** | Neutral narrator who converts raw logs into a brief chapter at the end of each tick.                           | Turns dry mechanics into an unfolding fable youâ€™ll want to read.          |
| **Shardâ€‘Sower** | Extradimensional artisan that forges brandâ€‘new agents, each with a unique quirk and singleâ€‘line superâ€‘ability. | Guarantees every run begins with a wildly different cast.                 |

Every tick these characters dance: Bonds mint Sparks, Agents act, Bob judges, the Storyteller records, and Shardâ€‘Sower stands ready to seed new minds when old ones flicker out.

### One Turn (Tick) in Six Beats

> *A hush, a hum, and then the world moves...*

| #     | Stage                   | What really happens                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Mint Sparks**         | Every bond counts its links (â€¯*nâ€¯Â·â€¯(nâ€¯âˆ’â€¯1)/2*â€¯) and the engine births that many fresh Sparks.                                                                                            |
| **2** | **Bob Decides**         | All `request_spark` pleas from the previous tick land in Bobâ€™s lap; he ponders urgency, fairness, whimsyâ€”and gifts up to **5 random Sparks** to any supplicant until his stash runs dry. |
| **3** | **Agents Act**          | Each living agent receives its private observation package and replies with **one message**â€”bond, raid, spawn, beg Bob, or simply reply.                                                 |
| **4** | **Distribute Sparks**   | Minted Sparks are handed out **one by one, at random** to members of each bond, ensuring longâ€‘run fairness but shortâ€‘run drama.                                                          |
| **5** | **Upkeep & Vanishings** | The tax for existing: every agent losesâ€¯1 Spark. Any who hitâ€¯0 dissolve instantly, severing their bonds and reducing future minting.                                                     |
| **6** | **Storytime**           | The Storyteller reads the full log and distills it into a biteâ€‘sized chapterâ€”alliances forged, raids won or lost, Bobâ€™s mercy (or lack thereof). Then the cycle begins anew.             |

A tick can last a second or a minute, but this rhythmâ€”mint, mercy, action, payout, cost, storyâ€”never changes.

### What an Agent Can Do (Singleâ€‘Message Rule)

In each tick an agent may say **oneâ€”and only oneâ€”of these magic words**:

| Command           | Syntax                    | Why use it                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bond**          | `bond <agent_id>`         | Invite another lone agent. If both send the invite in the same tick, a bond (and fresh Sparks) is born. |
| **Raid**          | `raid <agent_id>`         | Risk it all to steal **1â€¯â€“â€¯5 Sparks**; success odds scale with *strength = ageâ€¯xâ€¯spark*.                |
| **Request Spark** | `request_spark <reason>`  | Beg Bob for a donation (he rolls 1â€¯â€“â€¯5 Sparks if moved by your plea).                                   |
| **Spawn**         | `spawn_with <partner_id>` | (Bondâ€‘only) Pay **5 Sparks** to craft a brandâ€‘new agent who joins the bond.                             |
| **Reply**         | `reply <msg_id> <text>`   | Address a single incoming messageâ€”missions, apologies, threats, poemsâ€¦                                  |

No macros, no multiâ€‘actions: choose one verb, send it, live (or dissolve) with the consequences.

### Sparks, Survival, and Strength

*The universe writes its laws in simple arithmetic.*

| Rule             | Formula / Limit                                   | Consequence                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Lifeâ€‘cost**    | â€Šâ€“1â€ŠSpark per agent every tick                    | Fall toâ€Š0â€Šâ†’ pattern unravels, agent vanishes instantly.                  |
| **Bond minting** | â€Š*nâ€ŠÂ·â€Š(nâ€Šâˆ’â€Š1)/2* Sparks each tick                 | A trio earns 3â€Šâš¡, a quartet 6â€Šâš¡â€”bigger cliques, brighter payâ€‘days.       |
| **Random split** | Sparks handed out oneâ€‘byâ€‘one to random bondâ€‘mates | Shortâ€‘term luck, longâ€‘term fairness.                                     |
| **Spawning fee** | 5â€ŠSparks paid by initiator                        | Newborn enters at ageâ€Š0, Sparkâ€Š5, same bond.                             |
| **Strength**     | ageâ€ŠÃ—â€Šspark                                       | Used only in raid odds: *P(success) = attacker / (attackerÂ +Â defender)*. |
| **Raid haul**    | Random 1â€Šâ€“â€Š5â€Šâš¡, capped by defenderâ€™s balance      | Win â†’ take haul; lose â†’ defender steals that amount instead.             |
| **Bobâ€™s gift**   | Up to 5â€Šâš¡ per chosen request                      | Bobâ€™s stash is finite; once empty, only bonds can create Sparks.         |

These numbers are the heartbeat of Sparkâ€‘Worldâ€”easy to remember, ruthless in practice.
