# ðŸŒŒ Sparkâ€‘World

*Turnâ€‘based sim where autonomous agents bond, raid, beg a silent wanderer for energy, and write their own legend.*

## What is Sparkâ€‘World?

Imagine a world where **life itself is energy**â€”a single pulse called a **Spark** that keeps every mind alive. In this sandbox, every "mind" is a languageâ€‘driven agent that **needs one Spark per tick** to survive.

**Sparks appear only when agents bond**â€”the tighter the clique, the brighter the flow. Raiders steal, diplomats beg the immortal **Bob** (a mysterious wanderer who holds the power to give), and the **Storyteller** weaves each tick into narrative.

No graphics, just pure textâ€¦ yet alliances form, betrayals sting, and microâ€‘dragons argue with talking kettles.

## Why should I care?

* **Emergent drama** â€“ personalities collide in a rulesâ€‘light economy where every decision matters
* **Living characters** â€“ every agent has unique quirks and goals, crafted by the **Shardâ€‘Sower** (our character designer)
* **Modâ€‘friendly** â€“ plug new abilities or world events into one Python handler
* **Watch or meddle** â€“ run headless or open the Streamlit dashboard to push the "Next Tick" button and enjoy the chaos

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourâ€‘handle/sparkworld
cd sparkworld
pip install -r requirements.txt   # langgraph, dspy, sqlmodel, streamlitâ€¦
python main.py                    # launches WorldEngine
streamlit run app.py              # (optional UI)
```

**Implementation Note:** This is a conceptual design. The actual implementation will include:
- Independent LLM agents with unique personalities
- A World Engine to coordinate the 6-stage tick process
- A Storyteller to convert events into narrative
- Mission generation and management systems
- Bob's renewable Spark economy
