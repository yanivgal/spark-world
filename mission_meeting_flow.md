## 🧩 Mission Meetings – Collaborative Planning Inside Each Tick

### What is a Mission Meeting?

Every time a **bond** is created, it carries an active **mission**. Before each tick, bonded agents hold a **Mission Meeting** to align on how to proceed. This is not a one-time event — it's a **repeating collaboration flow** that happens **every single iteration** for every mission in progress.

---

### When It Happens

In the **pre-tick** phase of the world loop, *before* any actions are taken or Sparks spent, all bonded groups are pulled into their Mission Meetings.

### Mission Meeting Flow (per iteration)

1. **Start Meeting**

   - The **World Engine** identifies each active mission and its bonded agents.
   - It designates (or remembers) a **mission leader** for the bond.

2. **Leader Introduction (First Tick Only)**

   - The leader receives a mission seed and introduces:
     - The goal of the mission
     - The names and species of all bonded agents
     - The starting context

3. **Leader’s Opening Message (Each Tick)**

   - The leader reflects on the **previous iteration’s actions**.
   - Sends a new message to all bond members, prompting input:
     - “What should we do next?”
     - “What did we learn from last time?”

4. **Agent Responses**

   - Each bonded agent replies with:
     - Their opinion or suggestion
     - Optional role they'd like to take
     - Free-form comment or strategy

5. **Leader’s Final Word**

   - The leader receives all replies.
   - Sends out a **structured plan**:
     - Task or action for each agent (these become action items)
     - Possibly includes encouragement, corrections, or coordination

6. **Wrap-Up**

   - The action items for each agent are **recorded** in the mission state.
   - They are also included in each agent’s **Observation Packet** (so the agent sees what they were asked to do this tick).

---

### What’s in the Mission Observation Packet?

Each bonded agent’s observation packet now includes:

- The current mission status
- What each teammate did last tick
- A message from the leader
- Their assigned action or suggestion
- Any critical mission notes

---

### Why It Matters

This recurring meeting flow brings life to cooperation:

- Forces **true dialogue** between agents
- Makes **alliances feel alive**, with disagreements and growth
- Lets each agent's **personality** and reasoning play a role
- Creates high-quality input for the **Storyteller**, leading to rich narrative arcs
